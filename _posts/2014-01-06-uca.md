## **Job Position:** Researcher

At the University of CÃ¡diz I worked as a researcher in the applied robotics group.

I participated in two projects.



# **C.I.T.I.U.S**

---

This project consisted of developing two unmanned vehicles, a land vehicle and a maritime vehicle.
I worked on the team that developed the land vehicle, working on the low level of vehicle automation.

Starting from an electric vehicle, we had to make the necessary modifications to be able to control it.

Our goals were:
- Steering wheel control
- Brake control
- Acceleration control
- Lights Control

# ROBOTIC WELDING

---

This project consisted of achieving that two robots could carry out welding.

I was not in the entire project. I worked during a period, in which our task was mainly research on robots, trying to come up with a solution to apply to robotic welding.
